Web Security questions, ranging from 1 to 5 are the first category in HackIM. But it isn't neccessary to solve them first before others. So the challenge is presented as:

It's clear that the **Admin Console** was meant for us. So we clicked on it! But BAM!
This showed up,

That's bad isn't? Well, do some *googling*, as usual about *stackoverflow hacking* cases, and you'd have come across this; `Anatomy of an Attack: How I Hacked StackOverflow  <http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2012/11/anatomy-of-attack-how-i-hacked.html>`_. From the blog post, you'd see that the author mentions not to rely upon **X-Forwarded-For** for anything. Well, there's a hint isn't it. ;)

So, how do we go about hacking that challenge then? It's pretty simple, and most Linux distros already have it by default....

...drum roll please...

Mr. **curl** :D

So here is what we did you exploit it::

    ~$ curl --header "X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1" http://ctf.nullcon.net/challenges/web/web1/getflag.php

After that it will print out::

    ~$ The Flag is DholuBholuareTWINS

Sweet!? :D
