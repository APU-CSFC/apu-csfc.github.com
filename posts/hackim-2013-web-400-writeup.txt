**Web 4 - 400 points**

Again, like `Web 2 - 200 points </posts/hackim-2013-web-200-writeup.html>`_  and `Web 3 - 300 points </posts/hackim-2013-web-300-writeup.html>`_ we were given a link to the challenge. And this is what it displays:

So, we applied the same technique as **Web 2 - 200 points**, registered as **admin** with our own unique passphrase, and log in. After we login, we were given a mail sending feature:

Here, if you didn't login as admin, you would not be able to use the **Become Admin** and **Get Flag** functions. So, we went right ahead and clicked the **Get Flag** function and this spits out for us:

AWESOMENESS! :)
