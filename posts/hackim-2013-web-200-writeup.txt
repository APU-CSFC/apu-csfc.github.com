**Web 2 - 200 points**

We were given a url to the challenge and this is what it displays:

It's quite clear that you either need to know the credentials or to register. So, we chose the **register** route. We first tried logging with our own crafted credentials. But we were unable to **view** the flag that way. Thus, chose to register as admin afterwards. Of course, we chose a password that is unique for us. ;)

And well surprise...it was accepted!! AWESOME!

After we login we can see that the post named **flag** now has an option for us to **view** the post!

So, we clicked on the **view** link and out comes the javascript alert function that gave us the **flag**.

The flag is: **ChutkiisVERYcute**
