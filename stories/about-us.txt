We are students from `Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation (APU) <http://www.apuniversity.edu.my/>`_.

**APU CSFC** - APU Cyber Security & Forensics Club.

Our Aim and Objective:

    To foster an environment for learning, support, friendship and mentorship for Information Security and Digital Forensics students.

    To represent A.P.U at security competitions and workshops nationwide and internationally.

    To solve Security and Forensic challenges creatively.

    And to focus on the protection of Information Systems.

We collectively play CTFs online internationally as `Glider Swirley <https://ctftime.org/team/3132/>`_ with a few other students from different universities.
